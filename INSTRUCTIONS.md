INSTRUCTIONS | THE DASHBOARD

Running the simulation
Make sure you have imported os, simpy, json, random and enum from your terminal for the simulation to work
We have already produced enough data for two months, but if you wish to produce more data you can run the simulation as many times as you wish.
Reviewing the json DB
The database is generated after simulating.
Viewing the Dashboard
The HTML index and its tabs already have what is necessary to run the page (bootstrap, Chart.js, the json Data Base, the js scripts for the graphs and the CSS for the styles) 
Run the file "index.html", and change through the buttons on top to view the different graphs.
Visualization of the data | Animation
Press the "Visualization" button on top of the main page. Select your inputs to view the simulation, such as the number of stations and products and the speed to visualize the simulation.

Have fun!
